## react-navigation-sample
A sample that demonstrates simple react native navigation with react-navigation library

I see a lot of questions with no answers around how to use react-navigation. With react-native 0.44 release Navigator is gone and so is ExprimentalNavigation.

To get started, please refer http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

For react-navigation documentation and setup, please refer : 
- http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html
- https://reactnavigation.org/docs/intro/

This sample just demonstrates how to use react-navigation and optionally show/hide header, left/right navigation bar button items.
